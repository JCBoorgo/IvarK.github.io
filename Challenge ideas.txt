Do it all over again, without infinity upgrades

Everything is more expensive

Bying anything halts your production for 3 minutes

You don't have avvess to eight dimension, but tickspeed is more effective

Everything gets downgraded (1st gives half, 2nd gives antimatter, 3rd gives first etc.)

tickspeed upgrades start at 7%.

Dimension Shifts and whatnot cost double the dimensions (or maybe x1.5, doubling might be harsh)

multiplicative upgrades happen at random amounts, instead of multiples of 10
